# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Building deep neural network with Python using Numpy. This repo is the assignment one and two of the 4th week of [NN and DL course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). This is the first course of the [deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=17-DeepLearning-ROW&utm_content=17-DeepLearning-ROW&campaignid=6465471773&adgroupid=77415260637&device=c&keyword=coursera%20artificial%20intelligence&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=506751438660&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwtpGGBhBJEiwAyRZX2hF1E1NxL2xafjxDiCn3dpizdRu4UDsXS6mid1TRYA_jZz0D8PV_kBoChVkQAvD_BwE) that aims at giving a solid foundation about neural networks and how they are structured, built and run to either classify or predict before diving deeply with TensorFlow.
